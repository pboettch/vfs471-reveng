What?
-----

vfs471-parse.pl is a script which has to be used with Mauro's
parse_tcpdump_log.pl script from v4l-utils. parse_tcpdump_log.pl reads
tcpdump-files which contain usbmon-captures done with wireshark for
example and passes them, thanks to some patches from myself, to a
separate perl-script where the payload analysis/re-construction
can be done.

See Mauro's announce mail:
  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.linuxtv.scm/9636

How?
----

    $ git clone git://github.com/pboettch/v4l-utils.git
    $ git clone git://github.com/pboettch/vfs471-reveng.git
    $ cd vfs471-reveng
    $ perl ../v4l-utils/contrib/parse_tcpdump_log.pl \
        --frame_processor vfs471_parse.pl \
        <tcpdump/wireshark-capture-filename>

And now?
--------

Feel free to adapt/read/copy/steal anything from vfs471_parse.pl . I consider this code as PUBLIC DOMAIN.

However, do not forget to contribute your findings to
